    In 2020, after years of working in different fields with no clear direction, feeling unfulfilled, and with no
    financial stability, things needed to change. I decided to change careers, not that I had much of career to
    begin with.
    I started on my the path into the tech industry as a web developer.
    In 2021, I completed a coding bootcamp that introduced me to the world of web development.
    Eventhough I have not landed my first job in the tech industry, I continue to hone my coding skills while work
    full-time.
